Let's create a basic pong game using C and OpenGL. For now let's make it 1-player pong with the computer as the opponent. Create a basic AI for the computer that will move the paddle up and down based on the ball's position.

Create all the necessary functionality for the project so that it will be ready to compile and run.

Include a script that will install any necessary dependencies that are missing on Mac OSC. Prefer homebrew where possible for package management.

Also include a Makefile that will compile the project.
