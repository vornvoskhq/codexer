- Fix for a bug that was causing occasional model errors. Model calls should be much more reliable now.
- Better error handling and error messages for model errors (rate limits or other errors).
- No error retries for rate limit errors.
- Fixed bug that caused retries to add the prompt to the conversation multiple times.
- Error responses with no output no longer create a log entry.
