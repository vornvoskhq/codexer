## 🖇️  Connect your Claude Pro or Max subscription

If you have a Claude Pro or Max subscription, Plandex can use it when calling Anthropic models. You can use it in either Integrated Models Mode on Plandex Cloud, or in BYO Key Mode (whether on Cloud or self-hosting).

Assuming you're using Anthropic models (which the default model pack does), you'll be asked if you want to connect your Claude subscription the first time you run Plandex. Follow the instructions to connect.
