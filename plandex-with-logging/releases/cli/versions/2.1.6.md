- The newly released Claude Sonnet 4 is now stable in testing, so it now replaces Sonnet 3.7 as the default model for context sizes under 200k across all model packs where 3.7 was previously used.
- A new `strong-opus` model pack is now available. It uses Claude Opus 4 for planning and coding, and is otherwise the same as the 'strong' pack. Use it with `\set-model strong-opus` to try it out.
- The `opus-4-planner` model pack that was introduced in 2.1.5 has been renamed to `opus-planner`, but the old name is still supported. This model pack uses Claude Opus 4 for planning, and the default models for other roles.
- Fix for occasional garbled error message when the model is unresponsive.
- Fix for occasional 'couldn't aquire lock' error after stream finishes.
- Additional retry when model is unresponsive or hits provider rate limitsâ€”helps particularly with new Opus 4 model on OpenRouter.
