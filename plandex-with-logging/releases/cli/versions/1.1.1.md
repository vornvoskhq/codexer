## Fix for terminal flickering when streaming plans ðŸ“º

Improvements to stream handling that greatly reduce flickering in the terminal when streaming a plan, especially when many files are being built simultaneously. CPU usage is also reduced on both the client and server side.

## Claude 3.5 Sonnet model pack is now built-in ðŸ§ 

You can now easily use Claude 3.5 Sonnet with Plandex through OpenRouter.ai.

1. Create an account at [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) if you don't already have one.
2. [Generate an OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
3. Run `export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...` in your terminal.
4. Run `plandex set-model`, select `choose a model pack to change all roles at once` and then choose either `anthropic-claude-3.5-sonnet` (which uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for all heavy lifting and Claude 3 Haiku for lighter tasks) or `anthropic-claude-3.5-sonnet-gpt-4o` (which uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for planning and summarization, gpt-4o for builds, and gpt-3.5-turbo for lighter tasks)
